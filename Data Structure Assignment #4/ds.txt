Data Structures is my favorite Computer Science class at WCC so far.  
I have mastered simple arrays, dynamic arrays, linked lists, stack, queues, 
deques, and now binary search trees.  I was awake all night trying to think 
about how many things I can solve with a binary search tree.  I've got to run 
for president of the United States to solve the world problems with a binary 
search tree!  However, first I think I need to queue that task for now and
work on my current assignment.
